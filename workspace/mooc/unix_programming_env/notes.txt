-----------------------------
SHELL
shell or command interpreter sits between kernel and you.

Advantages: 
Filename shorthands, I/O redirection, define own commands

e.g:
#Print all chapters: chap1, chap2 chap3 etc.
$ > pr chap* 

Filename shorthand is a service provided by shell, not program.

-----------------------------

PIPE

Programs communicate via pipes to avoid temp files
ls | wc -l #Number of files in a folder

Programs are invoked simultaneously, not sequentially
Kernel manages synchronization and communication
Programs are oblivious to it.

who | grep ameya | wc -l #How many times ameya logged in

programs can read / write into a pipe

-----------------------------

SEARCH PATH
Current Directory -> /bin -> /usr/bin
can be modified by changing the $PATH variable
PATH=$PATH:/home/ameya/myprogs

to use PATH outside, export it
export PATH

-----------------------------

FILES
Files are NOT terminated in EOF
They simply end. Interpretation independent way.
Kernel call read() returns zero when file ends.
