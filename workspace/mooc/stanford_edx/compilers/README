Course Updates & News

NOVEMBER 3, 2014

Welcome to a public, self-paced version of Stanford's undergraduate course on Compilers. All course content is now available.
Content is broken up into sections, where each section is considered a week's worth of material. At the suggested pace, the course will last eleven weeks. Starting with the second week, we'll begin having short in-video quizzes to help you master the material, as well as a weekly multiple-choice quiz. We hope these assignments will help you learn the material at a level in a way that was previously impossible without one-on-one instruction. Halfway through the course there will be a midterm and at the end there will be a final, both of which will be structured as longer quizzes.
No compiler course would be complete without the opportunity to have the experience of implementing a full compiler for at least a simplified programming language. We realize that many students will have claims on their time besides writing a substantial software system for an on-line class, but we will have a series of optional assignments that, if completed, will lead you to build a full compiler for COOL, the Classroom Object Oriented Language.
Once you've completed the graded content with a score of 40% or more, you will be eligible to generate a Statement of Accomplishment. A Programming Statement of Accomplishment will be available to those who have additionally done the compiler project.
We hope you enjoy the course!
