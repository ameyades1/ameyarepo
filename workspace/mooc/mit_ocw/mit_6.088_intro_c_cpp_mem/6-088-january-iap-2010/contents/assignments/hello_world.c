 * Compile with the following command:
 *    gcc hello_world.c -o hello

 * There should now be an executable in your directory called "hello" which you

 * If you leave off the "-o hello" there will be an executable called "a.out"
 * which you can run the same way.
 *
 * Now try printing numbers and other things!
