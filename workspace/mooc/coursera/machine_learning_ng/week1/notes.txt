Supervised learning problems are categorized into "regression" and "classification" problems. 

In a regression problem, we are trying to predict results within a continuous output, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some continuous function. 

In a classification problem, we are instead trying to predict results in a discrete output. In other words, we are trying to map input variables into discrete categories.

(a) Regression - Given a picture of a person, we have to predict their age on the basis of the given picture

(b) Classification - Given a patient with a tumor, we have to predict whether the tumor is malignant or benign.
